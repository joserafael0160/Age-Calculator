# Age Calculator
This project is an Age Calculator that allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days based on their date of birth and a specific date they choose.

When the user inputs their date of birth and the date on which they want to calculate their age, the application calculates the difference in years, months, and days between these two dates. For example, if the user inputs their date of birth and the current date, the application can tell them how many years, months, and days they have lived so far.

In addition, the application provides a functionality to reset the input fields to the current date, allowing users to quickly calculate their age on the current date.

This project combines web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a functional and user-friendly Age Calculator. This is a great resource for anyone who wants to calculate their exact age in years, months, and days, or who wants to know how much time has passed since a significant event in their life. ðŸ“…ðŸŽ‚
